          <h4>Self Drive Car: What to Look for</h4>
          <p>Car rental services, whether they provide a driver or a self drive car option, are getting more and more popular today. There were only a few such companies a few years ago, but now there are dozens of high profile rental services that offer dedicated car rentals at really great prices. What most people want to know is - are they all the same or should you choose carefully?</p>
          
          <h5>What to look for</h5>
          
          <p>Where there are so many companies competing for your attention, you naturally get very good prices with most of them. However, you also get a few companies that will cut corners to bring that price down. You want a service that offers reliable vehicles for rental at reasonable rates and terms that favour the customer.</p>
          <p>Here are some of the things that you should look for:
          <ul>
 <li style="color:#000;">Does the company have its own website where you can read more about their services? </li>
<li style="color:#000;">How many vehicles do they have in their fleet </li>
<li style="color:#000;">Who is liable for damages if something happens to the vehicle during the rental period </li>
<li style="color:#000;">What kind of deposits do you need to make with them for renting </li>
<li style="color:#000;">Are their vehicles covered by insurance </li>
</ul>
</p>
        <p>If the company has a website, then you will find most of the information there. You do not want a service that doesn't answer important questions before you rent the service and sticks them "terms and conditions" in a long contract.</p>  
          <h5>Finding what you want</h5>
          <p>The next aspect to consider is more basic - which is finding a model that you want to drive. Many car rental companies have very few choices. This may be either because they are just starting out of because they do not have the means to make more expensive ones available to you.</p>
          
          <p>Some bigger rental services have hundreds of models of cars available for their customers. You are very likely to find a vehicle that you would like to drive with such a company. On the other hand, if you have no particular preference, you can use pretty much any service that has proven to be reliable.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h5>Covering costs</h5>
                    <p>Before you rent a car for self drive or with a chauffeur make sure that:
• The vehicle is covered by adequate insurance 
• The vehicle has breakdown insurance we as well as accident insurance 
</p>
<p>These two are very important because even if you can control your own driving, you cannot be sure about other drivers. Given the state of traffic that you encounter in most cities here, you want some extra safe financial measures to ensure that you do not have to foot a large bill in case of accidents or vehicle malfunction.</p>
